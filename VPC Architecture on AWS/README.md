# Deploy Scalable VPC Architecture on AWS cloud

### Goal
Deploy a Modular and Scalable Virtual Network Architecture with Amazon VPC.

## Pre-Requisites
- Must be having an AWS account to create infrastructure resources on AWS cloud.
- [Source Code](https://github.com/mukesh-mahato/React-Weather-Application)

## Pre-Deployment
Customize the application dependencies mentioned below on AWS EC2 instance and create the Golden AMI.

- AWS CLI
- Install Apache Web Server
- Install Git
- Cloudwatch Agent
- Push custom memory metrics to Cloudwatch.
- AWS SSM Agent

### VPC Deployment
- Build VPC network ( 192.168.0.0/16 ) for Bastion Host deployment as per the architecture shown above.

- Build VPC network ( 172.32.0.0/16 ) for deploying Highly Available and Auto Scalable application servers as per the architecture shown above.

- Create NAT Gateway in Public Subnet and update Private Subnet associated Route Table accordingly to route the default traffic to NAT for outbound internet connection.
- Create Transit Gateway and associate both VPCs to the Transit Gateway  for private communication.

- Create Internet Gateway for each VPC and Public Subnet associated Route Table accordingly to route the default traffic to IGW for inbound/outbound internet connection.

- Create Cloudwatch Log Group with two Log Streams to store the VPC Flow Logs of both VPCs.

- Enable Flow Logs for both VPCs and push the Flow Logs to Cloudwatch Log Groups and store the logs in the respective Log Stream for each VPC.

- Create Security Group for bastion host allowing port 22 from public.

- Deploy Bastion Host EC2 instance in the Public Subnet with EIP associated.
- Create S3 Bucket to store application specific configuration.
- Create Launch Configuration with below configuration.
    - Golden AMI
    - Instance Type â€“ t2.micro
    - Userdata to pull the code from Bitbucket Repository  to document root folder of webserver and start the httpd service.
    - IAM Role granting access to Session Manager and to S3 bucket created in the previous step to pull the configuration. (Do  not grant S3 Full Access)
    - Security Group allowing port 22 from Bastion Host and Port 80 from Public.
    - Key Pair

- Create Auto Scaling Group with Min: 2 Max: 4 with two Private Subnets associated to 1a and 1b zones.
- Create Target Group and associate it with ASG.
- Create Network Load balancer in Public Subnet and add Target Group as target.
- Update route53 hosted zone with CNAME record routing the traffic to NLB.

### Validation
- As DevOps Engineer login to Private Instances via Bastion Host.
- Login to AWS Session Manager and access the EC2 shell from console.
- Browse web application from public internet browser using domain name and verify that page loaded.
